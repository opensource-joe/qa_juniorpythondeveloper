# Introduction to Comments and Docstrings in Python

# Two types of comments in Python:
# 1. Single-line comments: Start with a hash (#) and continue to the end of the line.
# 2. Multi-line comments: Enclosed in triple quotes (''' or """) and can span multiple lines.

'''
Multi-line comments can be used for:
- Documenting functions, classes, and modules.
- Providing explanations for complex code.
- Temporarily disabling code during development.
- Adding notes for future reference.
- Any other relevant information that may assist in understanding the code.

# Docstrings are a special type of multi-line comment used to document Python code.
