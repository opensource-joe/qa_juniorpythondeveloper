# Introduction to Python Objects

## Intro to Python Objects
- Python Data Model. In Python runtime, everything is an object.
- Python is designed to make it easy for developers to work with data.
- Python is a C programming application. Uses Python runtime to read code and turn into objects.
- Objects include the attributes and behaviors to define a real-world model.
- Attributes that model behavior are methods. Commonly referred attributes are mostly likely describing data.
- Objects are used to model real-world and abstract concepts.
- Concept being modeled is referred to as an object type. The name of the concept describes what the object can do.

- Takeaways:
    1. Objects are building blocks for modeling real world or abstract concepts.
    2. Python objects are a collection of attributes. Attributes have two flavors, data and methods.
    3. Objects are foundational to Python because everything in Python is an object. Objects are like Lego bricks that can be combined to model more complex concepts.
