# Introduction to If-Elif-Else

- When Python reads an If statement, it expects whatever is between the word If and the colon to be considered True.
- Boolean objects - decision making in code revolves around the idea of something being in one of two states (True/False).
- Booleans are commonly produced as the result of performing operations or from calling code.
- The And and Or operators can be used to compare two different boolean expressions.
- Everything between If keyword and colon must evaluate to True for the code to run.
- The Else statement is intended to be used for defaults that should be set if the other conditions are not True.

- Takeaways:
    1) The If family of statements begins with the keyword followed by a condition which must evaluate to True for the code block to run.
    2) A boolean object models the concept of something being in one of two possible states.
    3) Python uses keywords True and False to represent the two states.
    4) If statements can be nested, which enables them to make more complex decisions.
