# Introduction to Python Collections

# Strings model sequence of characters.
# Integers model sequence of numbers.
# Floats model sequence of decimal numbers.
# Booleans model sequence of True/False values.

# Collections model sequence of objects. Collections are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Collections include: List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary.

# List: Ordered, mutable, allows duplicate elements.
# Tuple: Ordered, immutable, allows duplicate elements.
# Set: Unordered, mutable, no duplicate elements.
# Dictionary: Unordered, mutable, no duplicate elements, stores data in key-value pairs.

# Takeaways:
# 1. Collections are used as containers to store multiple items in a single variable.
# 2. Each type of collection serves a specific use case.
# 3. Four common built-in collections are list, tuple, set, and dictionary.
