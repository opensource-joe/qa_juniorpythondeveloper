# Introduction to Built-Ins in Python

# Python has a set of built-in functions that are always available for use.

# Cover useful functions for new developers.
# 1. Functions Interacting with Sequences - sum, len, min, max.
# 2. Functions Named After Built-in Types - int, str, list, dict.
# 3. Functions Used for Data Encoding that revolves around Unicode - ord, chr.
# 4. Functions Related to Objects for inspecting and interacting with object - type, id.
# 5. Functions Used for Name Binding - globals, locals.
# 6. Functions Used for Input and Output - print, input.

# Print function used for displaying text in the console.
print("Hello, World!")  # Output: Hello, World!

# Input function used for taking user input from the console.
user_input = input("Enter your name: ")  # Output: Enter your name: (waits for user input)
print(f"Hello, {user_input}!")  # Output: Hello, <user_input>!

# Takeaways:
# 1. When Python runtime starts, it loads a set of built-in functions.
# 2. Two built-in functions of note are print and input.
