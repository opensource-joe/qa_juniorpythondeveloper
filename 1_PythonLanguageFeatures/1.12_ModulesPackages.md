# Introduction to Modules and Packages in Python

- Scripts are common means of automating tasks.

- Modules:
    - A module is a file containing reusable code. 
    - Code residing inside a module becomes accessible to use by importing it. 
    - This provides us access to the modules objects from inside our own code file. 
    - Python standard library is organized into modules where each module contains object types related to the purpose of the module.
    - Modules used to interact with the operating system.
    - Modules used to interact wth the runtime.
    - Modules for networking, dates & times, etc.
    - Each module is built to serve some singular purpose.
    - Modules are a collection of reusable object types which share a purpose.
    - Some concepts may be fully represented with a single module. Some concepts may be very complex and require multiple modules. 

- Packages:
    - Group modules into a reusable unit based on the shared purpose of its modules.
    - Once code exists inside a module, we can import that code into our own code and use its object types to create new objects. 

- Use urlib to fetch a response from https://cloudacademy.com
```
import urllib.request
response = urllib.request.urlopen('https://cloudacademy.com')
html = response.read()
print(html[:100])  # Print the first 100 bytes of the response
```

- Takeaways:
1. A module is a collection of reusable object types which share a purpose including os, sys, and datetime.
2. A package is a collection of modules which share a purpose, for example, the urlib package contains multiple related modules.

## Exploring Modules and Packages

- Modules provide access to reusable code. Grouped modules into packages.
- Module is a standard Python code file which is a text file containing Python code. 
- Modules are different from scripts because you typically don't run modules like you do scripts. Import some or all module objects so you can access them inside your code. 

- Package is a collection of related modules. Where modules are just files, packages are folders containing modules. 
- To create a package, create a new folder in the file system then create a file called __init__.py. The existence of this file tells Python that this folder is a package. Runtime will use the folder name as the package name.

- Modules might include a function or two, or they could include hundreds of objects.

- Create a blackjack game
```
def blackjack():
    # import the random module
    import random

    # create a deck of cards
    deck = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'] * 4
    random.shuffle(deck)

    # deal two cards to the player and the dealer
    player_hand = [deck.pop(), deck.pop()]
    dealer_hand = [deck.pop(), deck.pop()]

    # show the player's hand and one of the dealer's cards
    print(f"Player's hand: {player_hand}")
    print(f"Dealer's hand: [{dealer_hand[0]}, ?]")

blackjack()
```

- Use dir displays all the names bound to the object. Can see everything the module can do.
```
import cards
print(dir(cards))
['Card', 'Deck', ...]
```

- Packages and modules are names after folders and files. Use single word names or "_".

- Takeaways:
1. To create a module, all you need to do is create a Python code file containing reusable code.
2. To create a package, all you need to do is create a folder containing modules and the special init Python file.
3. The Python runtime knows how to locate packages and modules by checking for folders specified in a special path setting.
4. The built-in dir function can be used to list the attributes of a module.
5. Use the model import syntax which imports the entire module and is accessible using the module's name.
6. Or use the object import syntax, which imports specific objects.

## A Tour of the Standard Library

- help() - in the interpreter to list the standard modules. Pass a string of the module name to get documentation for the module.

- The sys module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact with the interpreter.
- The os module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.
- The math module provides access to mathematical functions like sin, cos, and tan.
- The collections module provides alternatives to built-in types like lists and dictionaries.
- The random module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.
- The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

- Takeaways:
1. The purpose of the standard library is to provide developers with commonly required, generally useful object types.
2. The sys module provides objects used to interact with the Python runtime.
3. The os module provides objects used to interact with the operations system where the code is running.
4. The math module provides access to mathematical functions.
5. The collections module provides alternatives to built-in types.
6. The random module implements pseudo-random number generators.

- In the interpreter, you can use the help function to get help on a module or function.
- For example, help(math) will give you help on the math module.
- You can also use help(math.sqrt) to get help on the sqrt function in the math module.
- help()
