# Introduction to Exceptions

# Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions.
# They are typically used to handle errors or other exceptional circumstances that arise during program execution.

# Syntax error occurs when the interpreter encounters code that does not conform to the syntax rules of the language.
# Exceptions are raised when the program is running and can be caught and handled using try-except blocks.

# Try family of keywords: try, except, else, finally.

# Takeaways:
# 1. Exceptions are used to denote that the expected flow of code cannot happen for some reason.
# 2. There are two types of exceptions: syntax errors and runtime errors.
# 3. Exceptions can be handled using try, except, else, and finally blocks.
# 4. Raise exceptions using the raise keyword followed by the exception object.
