# Introduction to Comments and Docstrings in Python

- Two types of comments in Python:
1. Single-line comments: Start with a hash (#) and continue to the end of the line.
2. Multi-line comments: Enclosed in triple quotes (''' or """) and can span multiple lines.

- Multi-line comments can be used for:
    - Documenting functions, classes, and modules.
    - Providing explanations for complex code.
    - Temporarily disabling code during development.
    - Adding notes for future reference.
    - Any other relevant information that may assist in understanding the code.

- Docstrings are a special type of multi-line comment used at the start of a script module, class, or callable. When the interpreter encounters this style of comment in these locations, it treats them as documentation for a given context. 
- Docstrings are more than just comments. They are often extracted to become online documentation for developers. They are intended to help developers to understand the code so they can use it. 
- Docstrings tend to describe the purpose of the piece of code as well as details about input and output.

- Writing future comments:
    - They should convey something to future developers that will help them to better understand the purpose of the code. 
    - Comments should be expressive in describing why about certain code.
    - Can use comments on to have the interpreter ignore some bit of code. Commenting out code.
