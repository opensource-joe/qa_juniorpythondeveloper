# Exploring Dictionaries in Python
- Dictionary objects are containers for storing key-value pairs of objects.
- A key-value pair consists of two related objects, where the key identifies the value.
- Create a dictionary with {}.
- A dictionary's key must be hashable.
- A dictionary's value can be any object in the entire Python runtime.

- Syntax for creating dictionaries:
    1. Uses {} to define the dictionary.
    2. Uses : to separate a key and value.
    3. Uses , to separate pairs.

    Example: dictionary = {'name' : 'Joe', 'age' : 35}

- The syntax for accessing an individual value based on its key uses [] with the key inside the brackets. 
- The syntax for deleting key-value pairs uses the del keyword followed by the name to unbind.
- The way to merge two dictionaries is to use the merge operator.
