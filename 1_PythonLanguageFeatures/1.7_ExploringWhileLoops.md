# Exploring While Loops

- While loops are used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
- They are useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

- Example of a while loop with a condition
```
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print(f"Counter is: {counter}")
    counter += 1  # Increment the counter
```

- Example of a while loop with user input

```
answer = 9
guess = input("Guess the number (between 1 and 10): ")
guess = int(guess)

if guess == answer:
    print("Correct!")
else:
    print("Wrong guess. Try again.")
```

- Using break and continue in a while loop
```
while True:
    command = input("Enter a command (or 'exit' to quit): ")
    if command == "exit":
        print("Exiting the loop.")
        break  # Exit the loop
    elif command == "skip":
        print("Skipping this iteration.")
        continue  # Skip to the next iteration
    else:
        print(f"You entered: {command}")
```

- Takeaways:
    1. The purpose of a while loop is to repeat an action until some condition is met.
    2. The condition consists of any expression which evaluates to True.
    3. The keyword 'continue' is used to jump to the top of the loop and re-evaluate the condition. 
    4. The keyword 'break' is used to stop the current loop.
